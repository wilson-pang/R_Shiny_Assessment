**User guide:**

Users have to upload .csv file containing incremental claims paid data for each loss year and its respective development years, following **STRICTLY **to the instructions given in the app.

The raw data in the Excel file need not to be sorted according to loss year and/or development year. The app will sort it automatically.

There is no maximum loss years that the app can take. The number of rows and columns in the table will be adjusted automatically based on the data given.

For tail factor = 1, the first loss year in the triangle is assumed to be fully run-off. There is no extra column for ultimate loss.

For tail factor > 1, an extra column for ultimate loss will be added at the rightmost of the table.

Users can download the completed triangle as an Excel file back for further analysis or other purposes.

Users can visualize the trend of the cumulative paid claims in the app.
